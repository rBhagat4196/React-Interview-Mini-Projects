      question: "What is the purpose of state in React?",

      question: "What is a prop in React?",

    {
      id: 5,
      question: "What is the difference between state and props in React?",
      answer: "State is managed within a component and can be changed over time, while props are passed from parent components and are immutable within the child component. State is private and fully controlled by the component itself, whereas props are read-only."
